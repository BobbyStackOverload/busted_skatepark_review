# SKATEPARK REVIEW (BUSTED)

## There are errors in all but _two_ of the files in this project. Your goal is to find them, and fix them

- The app has been tested, and it does work when those errors are fixed.
- The app is based on the codebase that we worked with yesterday, and is current through the work we completed yesterday afternoon.
- It uses ElephantSQL to host the database, and the `conn.js` has all the correct details (that's _one_ of the files that doesn't have any errors).

## Getting started

- Fork this repo.
- Clone it to your machine.
- Run `npm install` (or `npm i`) to get all the dependencies installed.
- Run `npm run dev` to launch the app and start debugging.

## The bugs

- There are 12 bugs total.
- Most files only have one bug.
- _TWO_ files have more than one bug.

## The goal

- Fix all the bugs
- Commit your changes
- Push them to _your fork_ of the repo
